                        Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. 
                        In natural language, the readability of text depends on its content 
                        (the complexity of its vocabulary and syntax). Readability is more than simply legibility—which is a measure of 
                        how easily a reader can distinguish individual letters or characters from each other. 
                        Higher readability eases reading effort and speed for any reader, but it is especially important 
                        for those who do not have high reading comprehension. In readers with average or poor reading comprehension, 
                        raising the readability level of a text from mediocre to good can make the difference between success 
                        and failure of its communication goals.

                        This is a program written in C that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend a given text.                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First the program prompts the user to insert some text:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        $ ./readability
                        Text: 
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        As the outcome, the program prints out the readability level.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        $ ./readability
                        Text: Would you like them here or there? I would not like them here or there. I would not like them anywhere.
                        Readability Level: Grade 2
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        To calculate the readability level, the program counts the number of letters that show up in the text, 
                        the number of words in a sentence and the the number of sentences. Lastly, it puts all the pieces together, 
                        and calculates the readability level by using the Coleman-Liau index.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the resulting index number: 
                        <ul>
                            <li> 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduatereading level),
                                 the program outputs "Grade 16+" </li>
                            <li> less than 1, the program outputs "Before Grade 1".</li>
                            <li> for the numbers in between, the program outputs the exact Grade.</li>
                        </ul>

                <header>Reading Levels</header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        According to Scholastic, E.B. White’s “Charlotte’s Web” is between a second and fourth grade reading level, 
                        and Lois Lowry’s “The Giver” is between an eighth grade reading level and a twelfth grade reading level. 
                        What does it mean, though, for a book to be at a “fourth grade reading level”?  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, in many cases, a human expert might read a book and make a decision on the grade 
                        for which they think the book is most appropriate. But you could also imagine an algorithm attempting 
                        to figure out what the reading level of a text is.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So what sorts of traits are characteristic of higher reading levels? Well, longer words probably correlate with higher reading levels. 
                        Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too. A number of “readability tests” have been developed over the years, 
                        to give a formulaic process for computing the reading level of a text. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output what (U.S.) 
                        grade level is needed to understand the text. The formula is:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Here, 
                        <ul>
                            <li>L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text</li>
                            <li>S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
